### To setup Vagrant vm
```cd vagrant```  
```vagrant up``` to start vm  
```vagrant status``` to confirm it's up  
```vagrant ssh``` to ssh into vm  

Sample RHCSA exam tasks/questions are in tasks.md

To do: 
* add more tasks to tasks.md
* add another vm to vagrant file and configure as IPA server (could also be used for testing nfs and cifs) 
* configure vagrant to add a second hard disk for LVM practice
